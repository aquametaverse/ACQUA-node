The Acqua-node is integrated and interacts with LiFi.

Key TechnologiesReact 18 for UI components and state management
LiFi SDK 3.0 for cross-chain aggregation
Ethers.js 6.9 for Web3 wallet integration
Axios for API requests

The LiFi Integration feature of Acqua-node makes use of the @lifi/sdk package in order to access the LiFi's cross-chain aggregation capabilities and features.
The lifiService.js provides methods i use to get optimal cross-chain swap quotes, executing routes with automatic gas estimation, fetching token balances across multiple chains, and managing 3% slippage tolerance that seems to be the default for now.
